# rrr
## the stupidest feed reader

### usage
- put your feeds in the feeds file
- run rrr without arguments to build the cache
- run rrr with the numbers of the articles you want to read as arguments to open them in your browser

### to do
- stable support for various kinds of rss and atom
- maybe: color (if not: throw out defined colors)
- maybe: opml import (oof)
- maybe: if there's a cool way: dump articles into the terminal
- maybe: index read articles so they don't show up in the next run (when to purge those though?)
